# SVG Missile

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/leer0911/pen/xzjzYN](https://codepen.io/leer0911/pen/xzjzYN).

It's now possible to create some very interesting 3D effects in 2D with GreenSock's MorphSVG plugin. 

Here I'm morphing the missile fins from one shape to another to create a 3D look (supported by the fuselage lines that hopefully contribute to the effect).

Follow the hashtag #dailymorph on Twitter to see 7 days of morphing animations.
